VI. Course Schedule

1. Exams & Important Dates

a. Although TEST DATES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE, I estimate that the 4 major tests will occur roughly the week of each of the dates below. One-week notice will always be given when exam dates are ﬁnalized. These dates will depend on how the class is performing, days missed due to extreme weather, etc.

1. Exam 1 (App. A, Ch 0-2) — Tuesday, September 3rd

2. Exam 2 (Ch 3-4) — Tuesday, October 1st

3. Exam 3 (Ch 4/5-6) — Tuesday, October 29th

4. Exam 4 (Ch 7-8) — Thursday, November 21st

5. Final Exam (Cumulative) — (Tentative) Monday, December 9th (3 hours)
