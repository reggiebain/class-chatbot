a. Academic integrity is “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to six fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage” (International Center for Academic Integrity website). A lack of academic integrity prevents students from learning and undermines our community, and is therefore strictly prohibited. GSSM’s academic integrity policy (as explained in the GSSM Student Handbook) covers all school-related academic work, both in and out of class.
