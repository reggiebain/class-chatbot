b. Don’t Procrastinate: I recommend that students make time each day to work on problem sets in advance of the deadline. Cramming the night before an assignment or exam is an ineﬀective way to learn physics and will result in poor test scores. Physics demands a daily, systematic, and focused approach to studying.

c. Practice makes perfect: Solving physics problems is a skill that requires practice. It is NOT

a game of memorizing equations or solutions to speciﬁc problems.
