ll. Laboratory

1. Learning Outcomes

a. Lab offers students the chance to gain interactive experience with scientific principles, develop their data collection/analysis skills, and work collaboratively with other students to complete experiments and solve problems as a group.

b. Lab will consist of a mixture of hands-on experiments, inquiry-based group work, individual problem-solving, data analysis, experimental design, and online physics simulations such as those designed by the PhET collaboration.

2. Assignments

a. Students will complete weekly lab assignments that will be written in Google Docs and utilize Google Sheets extensively. Most labs will be submitted electronically to Canvas but some will be written by hand. Some activities will require students to work in groups of 3-4 and others will require students to turn in work individually. During most weeks, the assignment should be completed and submitted during the lab period.
