5. Tests/Exams

a. How they are administered: Unless specified by documented special accommodations in advance, mid-term exams will be given during class and must be finished during the 53-minute class period. Tests will be completed on WebAssign and primarily divided into multiple choice and free response (where partial credit is possible) sections similar to AP exams. Test corrections assignments may be assigned at the discretion of the instructor to potentially recover a percentage of points lost. This percentage will depend on the overall class performance on the exam and will be at the discretion of the instructor ona case by case basis.
