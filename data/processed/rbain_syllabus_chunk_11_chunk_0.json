b. Students SHOULD NOT leave these assignments until the last minute and should

individually budget several hours of time to work on problems each week that works with their schedule. Typical HW deadlines will be Tuesday/Friday evenings.

c. A list of daily reading assignments is posted on Canvas. Students should read the assigned

sections before each class period.

4. Missed/Late Assignments

a. Missed/late assignments without an oï¬ƒcial excused absence will receive no credit. If a

student will miss class because of an excused absence, students may request an extension from the instructor beforehand. They can request this extension directly on WebAssign. Extensions will only be provided for excused absences. Otherwise, no late work is accepted.

b. Valid excuses include classes missed due to documented illness or other excused

absences. Forgetting to do an assignment, neglecting to do an assignment due to other coursework, and running out of time are NOT considered valid excuses.
