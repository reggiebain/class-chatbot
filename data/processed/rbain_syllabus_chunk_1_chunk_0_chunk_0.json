3. Learning Outcomes

a. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to: b. Apply the laws of classical Newtonian mechanics (motion, force, energy,

momentum, and gravitation) to solve problems involving static systems, motion with constant acceleration, and rotational motion.

c. Use techniques of graphical analysis to classify and model physical phenomena and apply physical meaning to mathematical techniques from algebra, pre-calculus, and trigonometry.
